# Assignment 3: Programming Principles, SNU 4190.210

## Restrictions

**WARNING: Please read the restrictions below carefully.** 

If you do not follow it, **your submission will not be graded.**

1. Do not use the keyword `var` EXCEPT we have given. Use `val` and `def` instead.
2. Do not modify any `.scala` files without `???`. You can only replace `???` with your code.

Target codes: `NaiveEngine.scala`, `Matrix.scala`, `NDArray.scala`, `StackedArray.scala`, `Vector.scala`,
`Linear.scala`, `ReLU.scala`, `Sequential.scala`.
You cannot modify the other codes except the above target codes.

Again, your score will be zero if you do not follow these rules.

TIP: You don't have to understand anything about neural networks.
All you need to know is the way multiply two matrices.

## Grading 

We will run a lot of unit tests to test your code. 

Therefore, you should implement all the functions with `???` even they are not used from the given `Test.scala`.

Also, we will give you a pretrained weight and more complicated test codes. Please wait.

## How to run

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open `hw3` directory from IntelliJ IDEA
2. Mark `src` folder as **Source root** like below
![how_to_run.png](how_to_run.png)
3. Mark `test` folder as **Test source root** by the same way.
4. Run `object Test extends App` from `test/hw3/Test.scala` to test your implementation.

### Terminal

You mush check that `scalac` and `scala` are runnable from your terminal.

**Windows**

```shell
./compile.bat
./run.bat
```

**Mac, Linux**

```shell
bash ./compile.sh
bash ./run.sh
```
