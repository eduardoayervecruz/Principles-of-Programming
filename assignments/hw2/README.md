# Assignment 2: Programming Principles, SNU 4190.210

## Restrictions

**WARNING: Please read the restrictions below carefully.** 

If you do not follow it, **your submission will not be graded.**

1. Do not use the keyword `var`. Use `val` and `def` instead.
2. From now on, you can use some classes in scala.collections.* (except scala.collections.mutable.*). 
   You can  make your custom case classes.

Again, your score will be zero if you do not follow these rules.

Note that these rules will be gradually relaxed through the next assignments.

## Grading 

**Do not modify Data.scala**. 

We will grade your assignment only with the submitted Main.scala file.

## How to run

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open `hw2` directory from IntelliJ IDEA
2. Mark `src` folder as **Source root** like below

4. Run `object Test extends App` from `test/hw2/Test.scala` to test your implementation.
